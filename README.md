## Launching

Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` after installing the dependencies to start the demo.

## Comments / thoughts

Definitely an interesting challenge. I noticed as I went along that there was a lot of state 
to be shared inbetween the components, which made my initial architecture a bit hard to work with - 
but using a few tricks I managed to make it work decently.

I've left some more specific comments along the code as well.
